# Project API Documentation

**Overview**

 - **Base URL:** `http://<host>:<port>/api` (example: `http://localhost:3000/api`)
 - **Authentication:** Most endpoints require a JSON Web Token (JWT) passed in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`. Tokens are short-lived (issued for 5 minutes by the server).
 - **Error format:** All errors are returned with a JSON body in the shape: `{ status: "error", message: string, errors?: any }`. Validation errors include an `errors` array with `{ field, message, location, value }` entries.

**Authentication header**

 - **Header:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Validation & common errors**

 - **Validation errors (400)** — produced by `express-validator` and `validateRequest`, payload looks like:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": [
    { "field": "email", "message": "email is required", "location": "body", "value": "" }
  ]
}
```

 - **Unauthorized (401)** — returned when JWT missing or invalid. Example:

```json
{ "status": "error", "message": "Unauthorized" }
```

 - **Forbidden (403)** — user does not have required role or does not belong to classroom. Example:

```json
{ "status": "error", "message": "Access denied. You are not authorized to access this resource." }
```

 - **Not Found (404)** — resource missing. Example:

```json
{ "status": "error", "message": "Assignment not found" }
```

 - **Internal Server Error (500)** — unexpected error. Example:

```json
{ "status": "error", "message": "Internal server error" }
```

**Notes & implementation details**

 - JWT tokens are generated by `generateToken` and verified with `verifyToken`. Tokens must be provided in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.
 - File uploads for submission use `multer` and are saved to the `uploads/` folder. The form field name expected is `files` (multipart/form-data).
 - The server enforces role-based permissions in many service handlers (roles: `student`, `teacher`, `admin`). Ensure the authenticated token contains `id`, `email`, and `role`.
 - The `GET /api/students/:studentId/final-grade` endpoint returns a PDF stream with content type `application/pdf`.
 - Validation rules applied by routers are implemented via `express-validator`; check router files for exact constraints (e.g. numeric param checks).
